# CVE bin tool acquisition notes

## 7/18/22

Nothing before `1.0` ever ran, except `.3.1`. That ran at some points, but only
after using a more recent version to pull the database. I have more detailed
notes in my physical notebook, dated as 6/2/22. That was when I did a full run
for `0.3.1`, which is still stored as a product. That run failed for lscpu,
lslogins, sftp, ssh-agent, ssh-add, ssh-keygen, scp, and nothing else.

I remember deciding very early on to not include any versions marked as
pre-release, but I can not find a reference to this decision in my physical
notebook.
