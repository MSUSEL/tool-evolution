# CVE bin tool wrangling notes

## 7/18/22

I decided not to include any of the 0.3.1 results, because it reported 380 vulnerabilities for all softwares.
I decided to remove version `3.1` sometime ago, as it reported all zeroes. I am not sure if this is a problem with the way I am running the tool, or a known bug experienced by all users. I can see from [the tool's pip history](https://pypi.org/project/cve-bin-tool/#history), that `3.1.1` was pushed the very next day.
